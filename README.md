## Abstract

We consider the problem of classification in the presence of known measurement error. While the uncertainty on the classifier by measurement error could, in theory, be estimated by taking many repeated measurements of the observed objects, this is often not feasible or expensive in practice. In this report, we explore the possibility of assessing uncertainty in classification as well as robustness and stability of classification results in the presence of known measurement error by performing Gaussian perturbation on a single set of measurements.
