# 557-Data-Mining-Project
Clustering with measurement error project. Jonathan Hehir + Sarah Shy.

Data on Box

Coverage:
- Introduction: quantify uncertainty using known measurement error
- Application areas: astro, dp, earthquake idk
- Simulation of like variation crap
- Rundown of how this works, i.e. pipeline. Emphasize that you can use any classifier
- Talk about how perturbation has been used before for uncertainty quantification (along w. bootstrap) both both classification + clustering, but perturbation has more advantages and also we can use our measurement error directly
- Introduce astro data. train on blah, predict on blah. Use RF cuz why not
- Show results from perturbing 500 times
- Future work: clustering? ...?
