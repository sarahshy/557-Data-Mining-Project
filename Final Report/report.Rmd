Game Plan:

* Abstract
* Intro:
    + what is measurement error and why we should use it for uncertainty quantification
    + what is gaussian perturbation and what we get from it?
        - uncertainty quantification (important if we observe only one noisy instance, ideally measure many times)
        - stability (important for reproducibility, trustworthiness, more bs like that)
        - soft classification (for classifiers that don't have probabilities)
* Formal Gaussian perturbation pipeline
* Toy example for illustration
* Astro data 
* Discussion:
    + Recap what we have
* Limitations
* Future Directions and Related Work
* Bib
